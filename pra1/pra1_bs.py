#When calling the SSLContext constructor directly,CERT_NONE is the default.
#Since it does not authenticate the other peer, it can be insecure,
#especially in client mode where most of time you would like to
#ensure the authenticity of the server youâ€™re talking to.
#Therefore, when in client mode, it is highly recommended to use CERT_REQUIRED.


#This PEP proposes to enable verification of X509 certificate signatures,
#as well as hostname verification for Python's HTTP clients by default,
#subject to opt-out on a per-call basis.
#This change would be applied to Python 2.7, Python 3.4, and Python 3.5.

#foo = soup.findAll('a')

#soup.get_text()  # extracting all the text from a page
